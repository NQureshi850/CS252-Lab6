    <m>Our main mission:</m>
    <m2>To promote Computer Science and web game design.</m2>
    <p></p>
    <m>Our Goal:</m>
    <m2>We want to create a website in which people can easily submit their games written in HTML and JavaScript, and see their games run on the internet, playable by users everywhere.</m2>
    <p></p>
    <m>Our Story</m>
    <m2>The idea for the project started when one of the members created his first web game in high school. He had taught himself HTML and JavaScript, and wrote a web game. It wasn't a very complex or well developed game, but it was a game he wrote. He was proud of his work, and wanted to share it with others. However, he wasn't able to learn all about servers and data bases and things like that. Unable to put his game online and share it with others, the game was thrown in a folder somewhere and forgotten. Years later, when he and his friends got together, they thought of what it would be like if someone had created a website for people to submit their games, people like the high schooler that had taught himself how to write a web game. Together, they decided to create such a website. They wanted a website with an easy enough framework to allow anyone, not just people that have studied Computer Science, to write games, and have them featured on the website. With this website, they want to encourage people to try writing their own web games, and promote Computer Science to even ordinary people. They wanted to show that Computer Science isn't some mysterious thing that you cannot understand. They wanted people to see that Computer Science could be something fun, something exciting, something rewarding. They wanted more people to feel the excitement he had years ago when he created his first web game. Furthermore, they want others to have a chance to publish their games, to share their games with others, to have what he wanted, but didn't have years ago.</m2>
    <p></p>
    <m2>Thus, this project was born.</m2>
