    <h class="section-header">Submit Your Game</h>
    <p>We are currently taking submissions for HTML/JavaScript Games. However, in order to submit your game, there's a few things you'll need to do:</p>
    
    <p>We use a framework so that any game that follows it will be compatible with our server.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Make sure your game has some kind of a score system.</p></li>
      <li><p>Make your javascript class extend the following Game class: <a href="./model/Game.js">Game class</a></p></li>
      <li><p>Use the User class: <a href="./model/User.js">User class</a></p></li>
    <p></p>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're not sure how to do so, you're also welcome to right click on one of our games, and click "View Source" to see how the other games use these frameworks.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, contact us at: <a href="mailto:yu646@purdue.edu?subject=Feedback">yu646@purdue.edu</a></p>
